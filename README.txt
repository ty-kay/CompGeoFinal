Command line argument to run Fortune's Algorithm: "python main.py < test.txt"
In order to run on custom input, a different file other than test.txt can be used. However, please note that
the points should be bounded by -10,-10 < x,y < 10,10.
The txt file should simply contain a list of pairs of numbers (decimals allowed). Specifically, it should be an x
coordinate followed by a space, followed by a y coordinate.
